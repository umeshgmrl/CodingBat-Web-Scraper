/*We'll say that a "mirror" section in an array is a group of contiguous elements such that 
somewhere in the array, the same group appears in reverse order. For example, the largest 
mirror section in {1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 3, 2, 1} is length 3 (the {1, 2, 3} part). Return the si
ze of the largest mirror section found in the given array.maxMirror([1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 3, 2, 
1]) → 3maxMirror([1, 2, 1, 4]) → 3maxMirror([7, 1, 2, 9, 7, 2, 1]) → 2*/
