/*You have a blue lottery ticket, with ints a, b, and c on it. This makes three pairs, which
 we'll call ab, bc, and ac. Consider the sum of the numbers in each pair. If any pair sums
 to exactly 10, the result is 10. Otherwise if the ab sum is exactly 10 more than either b
c or ac sums, the result is 5. Otherwise the result is 0.blueTicket(9, 1, 0) â†’ 10blueTicke
