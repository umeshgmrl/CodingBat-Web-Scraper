/*Given an array of ints, is it possible to divide the ints into two groups, so that the sum of one group is a multiple of 10, and the sum of the other group is odd. Every int must be in one group or the other. Write a recursive helper method that takes whatever arguments you like, and make the initial call to your recursive helper from splitOdd10(). (No loops needed.)splitOdd10([5, 5, 5]) → truesplitOdd10([5, 5, 6]) → falsesplitOdd10([5, 5, 6, 1]) → true*/
