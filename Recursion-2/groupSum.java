/*Given an array of ints, is it possible to choose a group of some of the ints, such that th
e group sums to the given target? This is a classic backtracking recursion problem. Once y
ou understand the recursive backtracking strategy in this problem, you can use the same pa
ttern for many problems to search a space of choices. Rather than looking at the whole arr
ay, our convention is to consider the part of the array starting at index start and contin
uing to the end of the array. The caller can specify the whole array simply by passing sta
rt as 0. No loops are needed -- the recursive calls progress down the array. groupSum(0, [
2, 4, 8], 10) → truegroupSum(0, [2, 4, 8], 14) → truegroupSum(0, [2, 4, 8], 9) → false*/

public boolean groupSum(int start, int[] nums, int target) {
