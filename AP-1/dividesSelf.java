/*We'll say that a positive int divides itself if every digit in the number divides into the
 number evenly. So for example 128 divides itself since 1, 2, and 8 all divide into 128 ev
enly. We'll say that 0 does not divide into anything evenly, so no number with a 0 digit d
ivides itself. Note: use % to get the rightmost digit, and / to discard the rightmost digi
t.dividesSelf(128) → truedividesSelf(12) → truedividesSelf(120) → false*/
